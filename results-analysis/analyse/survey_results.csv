2,6,"Especially in the runs where the blobs ´crunched´ I could not keep track of all runs at the same time, so then it was nice to have a focus where the system triggered me to pay attention.",1,It did not help me deduce the patterns.,3,4,1,2,4,1,3,2,"My mouse did not respond as quickly as it does (now) using other programs, so I am expecting it to have been caused by this program.",18
2,5,"Although it was incorrect quite often, it did draw your attention quickly to potential anomalies. On the other hand, it could be that due to my attention getting drawn by the red borders, that i have missed some other anomalies.",2,,3,4,1,2,2,1,4,3,,43
2,3,It was not that helpful because you still had to check if it didn't miss anything and if it detected the right ones,4,-,4,3,2,1,1,2,3,4,no,51
2,6,"`Guides the eye, gives something to focus on and helps in training",3,"Distracting and first, but data accumulated showed trend and provided extra interaction option (clicking in the compressed view) this gave insight for the next test.",4,3,1,2,2,1,4,3,"I only had automatic detection once, this was in the sliding window view the first time",42
2,5,"It gave me something to focus on, a starting point in the sea of blocks.",6,I found the smaller colored lines without the time gaps in between of the compressed view a lot more insightful. A lot easier to find anomalies and also to look at more than 1 streaming line at the same time.,1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1,No.,12
2,5,often the detection would indicate a wrong anomalie making you go over the entire sequance again causing a lot of time delay.,5,"the compressed view could be handy, the history was often ties more misleading then helpfull.",3,4,2,2,3,4,1,2,,52
2,2,The automatic detection borders distracted me when I tried to get in a certain flow. It is something extra to pay attention to making it distracting.,6,For the long chains it was easier to see the distance between the orange blocks in that pattern.,2,1,4,3,2,4,1,3,No,63
3,3,Sometimes they were inaccurate so you had to waste time correcting them,5,The first time it was confusing but the last time it did help a bit to see the longer sequences clearly,4,3,2,1,1,3,2,4,No :),44
2,1,It felt like it was consistently taking starts of long patterns as anomalies and therefore costing more time than gaining.,6,"The aggregated view did very little for me, the compressed view allowed for better long pattern recognition.",3,1,4,2,2,4,1,3,No more than usual.,32
2,5,Yes the red borders were somewhat helpful. It's just difficult to keep track of all the predictions   together with the new sliding window data and analyze the other patterns as well.,7,I particularly liked the compressed view. It helped in detecting patterns more easily. Also because data changes more slowly in this view.,1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1,No.,27
2,5,"In some cases it was not correct, and then you need to spend time to correct it.",2,I did not look at it at all,1,4,2,3,4,2,3,1,"yes, first try it did not work. Needed to re-enter via email",47
2,5,"I think what was marked draw my attention, which was good for thinking about the streams. However, my attention towards the none marked tiles got lost.",7,"It was easier to see what the streams should be like, instead of having to remember somewhat what the stream was. Especially with long streams.",1,3,2,4,4,3,2,1,"None 
(One small remark on the ranking, I do not have ADHD, but I think I now know what it would feel like with just the sliding window views. Too much stuff was on the screen making me lose focus way faster than the compressed views.)",56
1,3,I ended up mainly checking the automatically detected blocks and checked too little the other ones.,2,"It helped in determining if a specific color should exist or not, but on the other hand, it decreased the window for the standard view of the cells, which made it less useable.",1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,No,29
2,2,"It took away my overview, because an extra element was added which I had to keep an eye on. Only scanning the pattern for anomalies was easier for me than also looking at the automatically detected blocks.",4,"It was a bit easier to remember what pattern was in what row, however it also was difficult to see how many blocks were in the compressed view.",4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4,,58
2,2,I felt like the algorithm made errors frequently en therefore I couldn't trust it,5,Detecting short patterns was easier in this view. The longer patterns were more difficult since it's hard to count blocks (in general),3,3,3,3,2,4,1,3,No,31
2,5,It took me a while to get used to the gaps.,6,The compression made it easier to oversee a longer sequence.,3,4,1,2,2,1,4,3,No,10

2,5,A pattern change was not well recognized by the red blocks.,4,The long patterns were hard to spot if there was a pattern change before.,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,No.,60
2,2,I have to look everywhere anyway and I sometimes forgot what the red and blue borders meant and what mousekey to click,6,the compressed view did as patterns are more clearly identifiable when they are longer. The aggregated view is not very helpful as you don't know whether small percentages are part of the pattern of historic anomalies.,2,1,4,3,3,4,1,2,No,36
2,5,I help getting my attention but I also had to check everytime,4,Only a couple of times,4,2,1,3,3,2,4,1,,7
2,6,"It did guide me towards blocks that could be wrong making it easier and faster to find the anomalies, however,all other blocks needed to be checked too for anomalies that might be missed by the automatic detection which I felt that I sometimes might have forgotten to do. On the flip side, because the automatic detection made me faster, when I did check for anomalies that were not dettected it felt like I had more time to find these ones.",4,"I'm not sure, both with and without history felt like they had some advantages. However, the task was difficult in both cases. Maybe the history slightly improved the situation but then very slighty.",1,3,2,4,4,2,3,1,No,49
2,7,"It's quite a lot of data to analyze. Sometimes you miss an anomaly, and the automatic detector finds them for you. Of course you still have to look around for other anomalies, but if there were a lot, it was a helpful tool.",5,I did not always look at the history since I was busy with incoming events. So if I had the time it was helpful,1,3,2,4,1,3,2,4,no,59
2,6,I felt like I was missing it when the automatic detection was gone. So yes it felt very helpful because it showed me many that were indeed anomalies. But I can imagine I missed more anomalies that were not lighted red because I was paying too much attention to the red lighted events.,5,"I used it to check the pattern again. Sometimes I got lost in the patterns, because you get unsure whether it's an anomaly or you just forgot what the pattern was. So the history gave me a quick visual of the pattern to be ably to detect an anomaly faster. However, it also took some space from the whole view, so I did feel more stresful in the end.",1,4,3,2,4,2,3,1,"No, none.",6
2,6,"I made you do a double take. Often there was a reason for the border if it was an incorrect indicator, and one of the other blocks surrounding it was wrong.",4,it helped with seeing the distance within de sequence however I feel like I did a better job in the one's without history for some reason.,2,4,1,3,4,2,3,1,No,50
2,6,It gave some guidance but was inaccurate upon change of pattern,2,"It was too much to focus on at the same time,",3,4,1,2,2,1,4,3,"Yes, during the start of the experiment the screen remained white.",11
2,6,"It could count the length of larger sequences, so that anomalies could be found more easily",6,It gave a reference to the past sequences,1,3,2,4,4,2,3,1,no,33
3,5,It draws my attention.,7,"It's very helpful, since I was able to look back and check for certain patterns.",1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1,"No, I fortunately did not encounter any technical issues.",38
2,4,"I felt like I got distracted by the red border suggestions, i.e. other anomalies were standing out less.",3,"It feels like it gives you more overview, because the blocks are smaller, but it is only half the window and you can't focus on both the small and normal blocks at the same time. Therefore it seems to go faster and it is a bit more stressful.",4,3,1,2,1,2,4,3,No,70
2,5,"At first, I had a bit of a hard time adapting to the speed of the moving blocks; then I seemed to get the system. However, I only find myself at least a bit capable after the automatic detection rounds. I don't know if they distracted me too much, or that after 2 rounds I seemed to recognize the anomalies better. Overall, it was a hard task",1,"Honestly, I didn't had a look at the history, I found it too distracting",4,2,2,1,1,2,2,4,"No, good luck!!",41

I preferred more history.",1,2,3,4,1,3,2,4,"If an anomality occurs close to a transition, it is ambiguous which events can be considered anomalous.  
Two times the same sequence, two single element changes that fix the sequence:

1 0 1 0 [2]  0  2 3 2 3, 2 → 1

It was unclear how long a fixed sequence could be. If a sequence of 20+ was allowed, I may have flagged too many anomalities.",24
2,5,The automatic detection focuses your vision almost solely on the red blocks,2,Too small,3,4,1,2,2,1,4,3,No,65
2,6,"especially helpful to check those, but maybe harder to find mistakes in the remaining blocks.",6,"I sometimes forgot the pattern, this function helped by enabling checking the history.",1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,no,39
2,,"It helped, but I'm not confident to what extent I might have missed anomalies that weren't selected by the algorithm. So, maybe my accuracy score was higher when I didn't see the red block borders, as I really had to investigate everything myself thoroughly, instead of relying on the algorithm.",7,"Loved the compressed view! Super helpful, 10/10. Didn't use the aggregated view at all, on the other hand.",1,2,4,3,4,3,1,2,No.,17

2,5,"It helped pick out some anomalies, but I feel like it also often selected the beginning of a new pattern which then cost me time to check something that was not an anomaly.",7,"In the compressed view it was much easier to see patterns in the blocks and observe anomalies, compared to the sliding window view. Especially longer patterns were hard to observe in the sliding window view, and much easier to spot in the compressed view.",1,2,4,3,4,3,1,2,"During run 4 I double clicked my right mouse button and then my browser went back to the explainer page for run 4. I could start run 4 again without much trouble, but if there are two recordings of run 4, the latest one is the completed one.",67
2,6,"Some where not correct (where indicated but where not an anomaly in my opinion), but it gave me a direction to look at. But it can be that I missed a lot of non-indicated anomalies.",6,The longer term anomalies were better visible there.,1,3,2,4,1,3,2,4,,20
1,4,"My attention was solely on the highlighted blocks. It took more time to unselect them and distracted me from finding the anomalies in the undetected blocks. Sometimes it helped, because I would not have detected the anomaly without it.",4,"It helped with the shorter patterns as these became visible through the compression view. The aggregated view helped in determining the frequencies for the two block patterns (e.g. one orange is easily detectable in a pattern of purples and greens). The new views made the regular view much smaller, which made it much more difficult to detect the patterns in general. Also, the compression view showed too short of a history for the longer patterns.",4,2,3,1,2,3,1,4,,25
2,5,"It did help me with finding anomalies which I would not spot otherwise, however it also added another layer of attention on top of trying to spot the anomalies by yourself.",6,"If the blocks were closer to eachother, it was easier to spot the patterns in the data, which also made it more easy to find the anomalies. This is mainly true for the orange blocks. 
I did not make use of the aggregated block",1,3,2,4,3,2,4,1,nope,8
2,4,"to me it seemed that the automatic detection often indicated the first block of a changing pattern, which is not an anomaly. in other cases it was helpful. i would say by feeling it indicated correctly about 50% of the time.",5,especially in the long patterns it seemed easier to spot anomalies.,1,3,2,4,4,3,1,2,"I don't think I did. one thing I noticed during the tasks: the row I had the mouse pointer on started lagging behind the other rows, but when I moved the mouse pointer the row quickly 'caught up' to the other rows to be 'in sync' again. I don't know if this was intentional but it did not bother me.",16
2,4,"It seemed to give many false positives when the sequence changed (e.g. from green-purple to green-orange. Because of this, I do not think I really trusted the detection.",2,"I found it harder to see if there 'odd ones out' were anomalies or part of a longer sequence rhythm, because there were less of the blocks on the width of the screen (of course, they were in the compressed view, but hard to incorporate in checking if part of the sequence because of their different size). I was unsure how the aggregated view could help me, since a sequence in a row could change during the three minutes. Because of this, the aggregated view seemed meaningless to me.",3,4,1,2,2,1,4,3,None,15
2,6,I feel my eyes cannot easily trace multiple moving lines to identify anomalies without any highlight,5,I can know what the previous pattern is.,1,3,2,4,4,2,3,1,no,26
2,7,"it at least gave a focus point, since there is so much going on, it helps you to make decisions on specific blocks.",6,"the history made it easier to spot longer sequences, and also as a focus reminder of the sequence of the row.",1,3,2,4,4,2,3,1,no,13
2,1,"Without the algo, there are no red borders. Any border (blue only) then means I've already looked at it. If there is 2 types, I can no longer use that visual cue, and am re-checking bordered blocks over and over again and start to go over the grid in a very random order trying not to miss any red blocks. It really moves my focus from 'only blocks without borders' to mostly blocks WITH borders. Detecting new anomalies myself is just pure luck at that point. 
Also, the algorithm sucks. I couldn't learn to quickly rely on it for any type of cases, so it did not provide much benefit.
(Maybe it would if I could rely on the fact that the algortm will NEVER miss any anomaly, but just mark too many. )",3,"At the start the distributions are helpful because they can quickly hint you for what type of sequence we are dealing with (one with long space repeats or without those).
But as a shifting pattern goes through, the distributions become mixed and less informative.
The compressed view seemed helpful for identifying the true long distance patterns. But clicking the right blocks in time was hard. But then again, this judgement of equally spaced distances is deteriorated by the fact that the compressed and normal view now share the same space, and it adds an extra layer of confusion/illusion. Judging anomalies vs long distance patterns close to the fold between compressed and normal is almost impossible. Just having one or the other is better.",4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4,"Some jitter in the compressed view (pixels at borders appearing / dissapearing) as the viz moves. Maybe I should not have tried to zoom in with my browser.
The movement sometimes stopped and continued (for some rows? not all?). maybe intentional.",64
2,5,"With the red blocks you had to focus on two things:
1. if the red block is indeed an anomalie or not
2. if there are overlooked anomalies that you need to add.
Without the red blocks, you can focus on one thing: finding anomalies.",6,It helps with remembering the sequence.,3,1,4,2,3,1,4,2,No,66

2,6,It gave me a an idea what to look for which was helpful and it let me reflect on what points might me a problem.,7,It helps to see the patterns a bit more clearly (it was a bit small),1,3,2,4,4,3,2,1,No I did not,73
1,5,"they highlight ones that could potentially be wrong, so those can be quickly investiated instead of focussing on all. however, I felt I had more control in 1 of the sequences without the detection help.",2,I felt distracted by it. wanting to compensate. If the data rows were just longer it was easier to comprehend,4,3,2,1,1,2,3,4,nope,9
