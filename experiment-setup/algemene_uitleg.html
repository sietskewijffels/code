          <p>
            You are asked to detect anomalies in streaming event sequence data in four different visualization
            implementations. The order in which you will evaluate these implementations is randomized. A general
            explanation of the task is given below but will be made more specific based on the visualization
            implementation.
            After you have read and understood these instructions, you can continue to the explanation of the first
            session by clicking the button below.
          </p>

          <h4 class="font-bold mt-5 mb-2 text-lg">Event sequences</h4>

          <p>
            The data that you are going to evaluate is visualized as colored blocks (events) that are organized in a
            sequence.
            The order of these colored blocks follows an easily recognizable repetitive pattern that is specific to that
            sequence but can change over time.
            Three different types of patterns are present in the event sequences:
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Short pattern of 2 blocks:</i>
          </p>
          <img src="images/short.png" alt="Short_pattern" class="w" />

          <p>
            <i>Long pattern of 15 blocks:</i>
          </p>
          <img src="images/long.png" alt="Long_pattern" class="w" />

          <p>
            <i>Changing pattern of 2 blocks:</i>
          </p>
          <img src="images/change.png" alt="Changing_pattern" class="w" />

          <p>
            A changing pattern will always be a short pattern of 2 blocks followed by a different short pattern of 2
            blocks.
          </p>

          <h4 class="font-bold mt-5 mb-2 text-lg">Anomalies</h4>

          <p>
            Anomalies (deviations or 'afwijkingen' in Dutch) are present in almost all streaming sequences that you will
            evaluate.
            It is your task to detect these anomalies by clicking on the anomalous block.
          </p>
          <div class="my-5 py-5">
            <hr />
          </div>

          <p>
            <i>Anomalies are single events that deviate in color from the contextual repetitive pattern.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Anomalous blocks replace the expected colored blocks in the sequence.</i>
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>In case a pattern is changing, the first new block of a changing pattern is <b>not</b> considered an
              anomaly.</i>
          </p>

            Examples of anomalies are given below:

          <h4 class="font-bold mt-5 mb-2 text-lg">Basic setup</h4>

          <p>
            12 sequences of streaming data are shown stacked on each other at the same time. Every row represents a
            single sequence.
            The events (colored blocks) will stream into the screen from the right side of the screen to the
            left side of the screen and follow one of the patterns described above.
            The white spaces represent data gaps in time, they are not part of the pattern but are
            just small delays between the occurrence of events. You are monitoring the streaming data simultaneously
            and are asked to detect anomalies in the sequences by clicking on the anomalies. The events that are shown
            on the screen at the start of the session do not contain any anomalies.
          </p>

          <h4 class="font-bold mt-5 mb-2 text-lg">Interactions</h4>

          <p>
            If you left-click on a block, the block will get a blue border indicating that you have selected it as an
            anomaly.
          </p>

          <img src="images/general_instruction_left_click.png" alt="general_instruction_left_click" class="w" />

          <p>
            If you right-click on a selected anomaly, the border of the block will be removed indicating that you have
            de-selected it as an anomaly. This could be useful if you have selected a block by accident or if you
            changed your decision.

          <h3 class="font-bold mt-5 mb-2 text-lg">Summary</h3>

          <p>
            Click on the blocks that deviate in color or from the contextual repetitive pattern for that sequence
            (row).
            Whether you consider an event anomalous only depends on the pattern of the corresponding sequences (row).
            The first block of a changing pattern is <b>not</b> considered an anomaly.
