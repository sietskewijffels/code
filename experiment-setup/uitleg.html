              In this session, the sequences are visualized using a

            <p>
              An anomaly detector highlights potential anomalies by coloring
              the border of the event red. This algorithm is not perfect and
              can miss specific anomalies or misjudge and label normal events
              as anomalies. Be aware that you keep an eye on the unmarked events as well to detect anomalies.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your interaction with the visualization will influence the
              sensitivity of the algorithm per sequence.
            </p>

            <img src="images/version_3_anomaly_detector.png" alt="version_3_anomaly_detector" class="w mx-auto" />

            <p>
            <p>
              You can agree with the algorithm and left-click on the
              highlighted event to confirm the detection of an anomaly. The border color will change to blue.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can disagree with the algorithm and right-click the
              highlighted event to un-mark the event, it is not registered as
              an anomaly.

            <p>
              It is important that you interact (agree/disagree) with the visualization to adjust the sensitivity of the
              algorithm. If you do not interact with a
              highlighted event, and it leaves the screen with a red border, the event is considered a normal event and

              In the compressed view, events are still shown in the same order
              as they entered the screen, but the width is reduced. The
              aggregation view shows a distribution of all the events that are
              older than the ones shown on the screen. The separate colors
              indicate the percentage of events of a specific type with
              respect to the total number of events that are older than the
              events shown in compressed and normal view.

              changed your decision.

            <p>
              An anomaly detector highlights potential anomalies by coloring
              the border of the event red. This algorithm is not perfect and
              can miss specific anomalies or misjudge and label normal events
              as anomalies. Be aware that you keep an eye on the unmarked events as well to detect anomalies.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your interaction with the visualization will influence the
              sensitivity of the algorithm per sequence.
            </p>

            <img src="images/version_4_anomaly_detector.png" alt="version_4_anomaly_detector" class="w mx-auto" />

            <p>
            <p>
              You can agree with the algorithm and left-click on the
              highlighted event to confirm the detection of an anomaly. The border color will change to blue.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can disagree with the algorithm and right-click the
              highlighted event to un-mark the event, it is not registered as
              an anomaly.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is important that you interact (agree/disagree) with the visualization to adjust the sensitivity of the
              algorithm. If you do not interact with a
              highlighted event, and it leaves the screen with a red border, the event is considered a normal event and
              not flagged anomalous.

            <p>
              Anomalies (deviations or 'afwijkingen' in Dutch) are present in almost all streaming sequences that you will
              evaluate.
              It is your task to detect these anomalies by clicking on the anomalous block.

            <p>
              <i>Anomalies are single events that deviate in color from the contextual repetitive pattern.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Anomalous blocks replace the expected colored blocks in the sequence.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
              <i>In case a pattern is changing, the first new block of a changing pattern is <b>not</b> considered an
                anomaly.</i>

              Click on the blocks that deviate in color or from the contextual repetitive pattern for that sequence
              (row).
              Whether you consider an event anomalous only depends on the pattern of the corresponding sequences
              (row).
              The first block of a changing pattern is <b>not</b> considered an anomaly.
